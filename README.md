From the given data, we can use simple visualisations to get a sense of how data are distributed We can conduct preliminary analyses simply by subsetting data sets using well thought out thresholds and conditions
Just wrapped up an insightful analysis of employee data, exploring the impact of healthy eating habits, active lifestyles, and age on salary trends. Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I visualized key patterns, including:

information about employee.
In this exercise, you will perform the following tasks:
1-Load and study the data
2 -Visualise the distributions of ratings and compensations
3-Subset the data based on thresholds

Load the data and study its features such as:
The number of employees
The number of features
The types of features

We will now visualise the distributions of employee ratings and compensations
We will create the following plots:
A scatter plot of employee age and employee salary, healthy_eating and active_lifestyle, health_eating and salary
A count plot of groups
A histogram of employee salary

we observe that in general, there is a relation ship between healthy_eating and active lifestyle of employee
As healthy_eating increases, the active_lifestyle also increases

We observe that in general, there is a relationship between age and Salary of employee
As age increases, the Salary also increases , though there are some outliers present as well

We observe that in general, there is a relationship between healthy_eating and salary of employee
As healthy_eating increases, the salary also increases

We see that most employees either belong to Group A or Group 0, with group A having maximum frequency

We will now subset the original data frame based on the following conditions:
Employees with healthy_eating greater than8
Employees with Salary less than 1000
Employees with healthy_eating greater than 8 and with salary less than 1000

The only employee seemingly facing a discrepancy in salary as compared to healthy_eating is employee who is having id = 26

The onlyemployee seemingly facing a discrepancy in salary as compared to healthy_eating is employee who is having id=2c
The employee wih id having 26 has a salary of 700

**Final Conclusion:-**
From the given data, we can use simple visualisations to get a sense of how data are distributed
We can conduct preliminary analyses simply by subsetting data sets using wel thought out thresholds and conditions
